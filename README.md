Inspired by [parrot](https://github.com/aquelemiguel/parrot).
Removed multiple message and response to avoid notifications and spamming channels.

## To do

- [ ] Separate between major errors which should return directly and minor errors for which a simple warning message should be issued (failed to update queue message should not be a major error)
- [ ] Save and load playlists
- [ ] Bot stops streaming after 30 minutes or so
- [ ] Review locks, might be locking way too much
